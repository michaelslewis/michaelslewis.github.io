  <h2 class="sectionHead" id="gettingResponses">JSON and the query response</h2>
  <p class="lead">
      On the previous page, we modified our search in an attempt to retrieve information on Tian Fu Noodle, located in Corvallis. Until now, the response to that request, and especially to the earlier 'food' query, have appeared as lengthy blobs of semi-formatted text that is relatively difficult to read. On this page, we will attempt to decipher those results.

      <br><br>

      I had initially noticed the Tian Fu Noodle restaurant as its name was the very first result out of 289 businesses that were returned in our original 'food' query. As an e-Campus student and a noodle-lover, I would like to know more about this restaurant for any visits I may make to Oregon State University in the future. The data that is returned to us from our queries arrives in the <mark>JSON</mark> format. As mentioned on the previous page, although JSON's syntax is not identical, it is close in appearance to the JavaScript Object Notation that we used to define the parameters of our queries. On the previous page, I provided a link to view the response from our query for Tian Fu Noodle as raw, unparsed text. Here is the same response as it would appear with each parameter name/value pair, as parsed onto separate lines for better readability:


    <div class="panel panel-default">
      <div class="panel-heading">
    <h3 class="panel-title">Code sample: Response from query for 'Tian Fu Noodle' in 'Corvallis':</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="panel-body">

      <iframe width="100%" height="550" src="https://jsfiddle.net/mikey811fiddle/8p1o0s28/embedded/html/dark/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

      <br><br>

    <p class="lead">
      Please scroll through the response above while observing the parameter name/value pairs that were returned. Much of the data may look familar, such as the address, telephone number, and the star rating. Other parameters included in our response include:

      <br><br>

    <div class="paramList">
      <ul>
        <li>The restaurant category: "Chinese"</li>
        <li>A subcategory: "Noodles"</li>
        <li>The business location, including its address in the city of "Corvallis" and the state of "OR"</li>
        <li>The longitude and latitude of the business</li>
        <li><span class="split">A snippet of text returned from one of the reviews. In the result from our query, this returns the text: <code>"YAAAAASSS. My roommate took me here to get lunch and it is truly delicious! I just moved here and was kind of missing some good asian food. The restaurant..."</code></span></li>
        <li><span class="inlineImage">An image representing the business's star rating: <img class="yelpFood" src=https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/2/www/img/22affc4e6c38/ico/stars/v1/stars_large_5.png alt="5 Star Rating"></span></li>
        <li><span class="inlineImage">An image for the business (in this case, it appears to be one of the dishes that they serve): <img class="yelpFood" src=https://s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GqLVAqzXHGYjkbYsblTDQg/ms.jpg alt="5 Star Rating"></span></li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p class="lead">As noted previously, Yelp provides an index to the search parameters in the <a href ="https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api/" target="_blank"> Search API </a> tab of their documentation page. The parameters above are only a small sample of the possibilities that can be returned, depending on the search query and the results.
        <br><br>

        <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
        Note that JSON data can be parsed and organized for an application, such as a mobile app, so that a user may have immediate and efficient access to any of these fields. Depending on the web application, a response such as what we received above can be formatted in various ways, tailored however a developer may see fit.
        </div>

      </div>

    <p class="lead">
      We should now be able to formulate a search, send it as a GET request, and receive the JSON response. Through our examples, we have narrowed our search from nearly 300 restaurants, to a single restaurant that fit the criteria of what we were looking for, with a very promising 5-star rating. I hope that this guide may help you if you whether you are specifically interested in the Yelp Search API, APIâ€™s in general, or looking for some delicious food while visiting Oregon State University. I look forward to an opportunity in the near future where I may visit the campus in Corvallis, so that I may be able to taste this result!
