  <h2 class="sectionHead" id="introToYelp">An Introduction to Yelp</h2>

  <dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>What is Yelp?</dt><dd>Yelp is a popular social networking site that allows users to provide unsolicited reviews on businesses.</dd>
  
  <dt>Why use it?</dt><dd>Have you ever visited a business, such as a restaurant, and had such a positive experience that you wanted to share it with others? Or had such a negative experience that you felt it necessary to warn people about it? Yelp provides a service that makes doing this simple. And if you are in need of finding a local business, Yelp makes it easy to find establishments that others have already reviewed. Users rate business on a 5-star scale, and can provide detailed reviews for visitors to read.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h2 class="sectionHead" id="introToAPI"> What is an API...and why would I want to use one?</h2>

  <dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>Why an API?: </dt><dd>API stands for <mark>Application Programming Interface</mark>.</dd>
  <dt>Description: </dt><dd>An API allows for web applications to access the functionality of a service like Yelp, providing an end user with the ability to retrieve information. Those who have previously visited yelp.com may already be aware of the usefulness of the website. Many of those benefits can be accessed through an external web application that you, I, or someone else may deploy, by including a script that calls the Yelp API.</dd>
  <dt>Example: </dt><dd>If I were to design a website pertaining to the city of Corvallis, I could include a section that returned recommendations for local restaurants or other businesses, with customized specificity, through a call to the Yelp API. If I wanted to, it would be possible to search for a certain cuisine, within a particular radius of Corvallis. I could further refine my search by adding additional supported parameters, such as the average star rating that the business has received.
