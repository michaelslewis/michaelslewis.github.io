  <dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>About Yelp:</dt><dd>Currently, Yelp offers v2.0 of its API, which allows for searching for businesses by means of parameters. While this guide focuses on v2.0 and this is still supported by Yelp at the time of this writing, Yelp is in the process of transitioning to a newer v3.0 API, dubbed "Yelp Fusion". Fusion is beyond the scope of this guide, as it has added requirements for developers in order to access the API, such as submitting the URL of the app under development.</dd>

  <dt>Authentication:</dt><dd>In order to incorporate the Yelp API into your web application, it is necessary to register to get an authentication key, or <mark>API key</mark>. This process is free and the link for managing your Yelp authentication is <a class="splitNoInline" href ="https://www.yelp.com/developers/v2/manage_api_keys" target="_blank">https://www.yelp.com/developers/v2/manage_api_keys.</a> It will first be necessary to create a Yelp account, which is a relatively simply process that is free of charge (although paid accounts can be created, providing commercial and other users a premium level of access, alllowing for a greater number of requests and other features). For our purposes, it is only necessary to register for the free account, as this allows for 25,000 daily calls of the API, which is likely well within the limits of most non-commercial purposes. Once you have signed up, simply return to the above link, and click on the button that reads "Generate new API v2.0 token/secret". This will provide you with a unique <mark>Consumer Key</mark> and <mark>Token</mark>, which we will discuss further on the next page. Your unique information will be available whenever you access the page for managing your Yelp authentication, as long as you are signed into their site. As the site states, it is very important that you never share your key or token with anyone else, as this information is sensitive and you would not want to compromise it. Therefore, in this guide, please note that in the samples of code that I have included, I have used the characters <mark>####</mark> wherever your unique values are required, so you will have to substitute your values in, as appropriate. Your authentication allows for a limited number of API calls per day (as mentioned above, the free, default account allows for 25,000 daily calls). Anyone who gets your information would be able to use it and it could affect your daily limit, or even have other potentially more serious security ramifications. Fortunately, if needed, a new key and token can be generated on Yelp's Manage API Keys page, linked to above. 

  <br><br>Unfortunately, the Yelp authentication process is a bit more tricky than that of some other API's. It uses the OAuth 1.0a protocol, which requires several parameters, including the Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Token, and Token Secret that were generated for us, in order to generate another parameter called a <mark>request signature</mark>, as well as other information. These must be submitted with each request to the API. Therefore, this guide will show how to use a development environment (such as FLIP) in order to host a client script that will generate the signature.  Not to worryâ€”guidance for setting this up and making calls will be provided on the next page.
